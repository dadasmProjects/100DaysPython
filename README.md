<h1> 100 Days of Coding (Python) </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Coding is something that has always come as a challenge to me and while the concept has always been interesting, through my degree, I always found myself struggling to follow along in the class usually because I always ended up focusing on my other classes more, simply because they were more enjoyable to me. This is a personal blog that I wanted to create to track my progress throughout the next 100 days because even though I have some basic knowledge (enough to stumble my way through building a web scraper) I wanted to see how much 100 straight days of coding would improve my knowlege. 
<br />


<h2>Language</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 

<h2>Day 1 </h2>

Day 1 was a very basic intro to python and contained concepts that I was already familiar with. Concepts such as printing out text, taking input from a user, and concatenation were covered in todays lesson and by the end of it, I made a program that took user input and output a band name by concatenating the two strings. Overall it was a nice intro back into Python.

<h2>Day 2 </h2>

Day 2 was much more of a challenge for me, but definitely manageable and it gave me that feeling of accomplishment upon completing the final program. Today the lectures went over data types which included: strings, floating point numbers, integers, and boolean. The final program that I created for this day was a program that was designed to output the amount that each individual has to pay for dinner after being given the total price of the bill, the party size, and the percentage tip that you wanted to give. The final output also needed to be rounded to the hundreths place, which was accomplished by using "round(bill, 2)"
<br />

Just as a personal note, I find myself getting the correct answer when it comes to the output, however when looking at the answer code, mine is not quite as efficient. Something to improve on in the future is to actually do the math when declaring the variable because it saves a lot of equation writing for myself. Looking forward to day 3 tomorrow!
