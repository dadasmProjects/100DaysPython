<h1> 100 Days of Coding (Python) </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Coding is something that has always come as a challenge to me and while the concept has always been interesting, through my degree, I always found myself struggling to follow along in the class usually because I always ended up focusing on my other classes more, simply because they were more enjoyable to me. This is a personal blog that I wanted to create to track my progress throughout the next 100 days because even though I have some basic knowledge (enough to stumble my way through building a web scraper) I wanted to see how much 100 straight days of coding would improve my knowlege. 
<br />


<h2>Language</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 

<h2>Day 1 </h2>

Day 1 was a very basic intro to python and contained concepts that I was already familiar with. Concepts such as printing out text, taking input from a user, and concatenation were covered in todays lesson and by the end of it, I made a program that took user input and output a band name by concatenating the two strings. Overall it was a nice intro back into Python.

<h2>Day 2 </h2>

Day 2 was much more of a challenge for me, but definitely manageable and it gave me that feeling of accomplishment upon completing the final program. Today the lectures went over data types which included: strings, floating point numbers, integers, and boolean. The final program that I created for this day was a program that was designed to output the amount that each individual has to pay for dinner after being given the total price of the bill, the party size, and the percentage tip that you wanted to give. The final output also needed to be rounded to the hundreths place, which was accomplished by using "round(bill, 2)"
<br />

Just as a personal note, I find myself getting the correct answer when it comes to the output, however when looking at the answer code, mine is not quite as efficient. Something to improve on in the future is to actually do the math when declaring the variable because it saves a lot of equation writing for myself. Looking forward to day 3 tomorrow!

<h2>Day 3 </h2>

Day 3 was all about conditional operators and logical operators. It honestly felt like a lot of work to fit into one hour so I actually was unable to complete the entire day 3 material. The exercise that took me the longest time was the leap year checker program. The course instructor gave us the assingment on codingrooms (https://app.codingrooms.com/management/assignments/364924/overview) and we were given all the equations that we needed, but had to make the program to check if a given year was a leap year or not. I actually did not have any issues getting the if/else statements setup, but what did give me issues was using the correct mathamatical opperator to check if there was a remainder or not. For a personal note, using "%" was the solution to this problem. This took up the majority of my time for the day, and I will continue working on the day 3 material tomorrow. The challenge was enjoyable and I am finding that coming up with coding solutions uses a different thinking method and I am rather enjoying how the learning process as it is a challenge, but not overwhelmingly so.

<h2>Day 4 </h2>

I finally got through the day 3 material today! I think that taking my time with conditional and logical operators was a good call. While I do understand which each operator does, when given a task it will take me a bit to figure it all out. The method of creating a flow chart really helps visualize this process. Overall, not a whole lot to add onto from yesterdays notes. The final project was a choose your own adventure game that honestly wasn't too challenging after completing the previous challenges. I am looking forward to moving on to a new concept tomorrow!

<h2>Day 5 </h2>

Today I was able to get through most of the Day 4 content aside from the final assignment. The concepts covered in today's work were randomization and lists, which compared to the day 3 material, I felt like I understood quite quickly. I think that is because with conditional statements, it is just a different way of thinking. While I understood how they worked, actually building these if/else statements was difficult. Either way, today I made a coin flip program, a program that randomly chose who was going to pay for dinner, and then a treasure map program. The treasure map program was the most difficult of the bunch and I couldn't wrap my head around how to place the 'x' on the map, but after some work I was able to get it done with the help of the lecture. Tomorrow I am going to complete the rock, paper, scissors program. It is a bit of an intimidating one, but I am hoping that I can break it down into small bits so that it doesn't feel as daunting. 

<h2>Day 6 </h2>

I picked back up on Monday and started off strong with loops! This is a concept that I generally knew how they worked, but I found out that I knew way less than I thought. I'm glad the course had many exercises to run through because I was struggling to actually make use of for loops. After doing about 5 or 6 exercises, I was able to complete the password generator program without too much of an issue, which felt really nice. I decided to take the weekend off because I did find myself getting a bit frustrated with myself. The 100 days of coding challenge is something that first and foremost is to better understand python and trying to complete all 100 days of content in the 100 days is a goal that would be great, but not at the expense of not properly learning the concepts. Looking forward to tomorrow!

<h2>Day 7 </h2>

One week down! It was all about while loops and functions today. Functions are always a little weird for me to get my head around at first, but honestly I felt pretty good today. I didn't get through all of the days content, but I will be picking that back up tomorrow as there is a decent little project to work on that might give me a good challenge. Not much to report today so I am going to keep this entry short!
