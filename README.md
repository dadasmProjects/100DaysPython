<h1> 100 Days of Coding (Python) </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Coding is something that has always come as a challenge to me and while the concept has always been interesting, through my degree, I always found myself struggling to follow along in the class usually because I always ended up focusing on my other classes more, simply because they were more enjoyable to me. This is a personal blog that I wanted to create to track my progress throughout the next 100 days because even though I have some basic knowledge (enough to stumble my way through building a web scraper) I wanted to see how much 100 straight days of coding would improve my knowlege.

<h2>Language</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 

<h2>Day 1 </h2>

Day 1 was a very basic intro to python and contained concepts that I was already familiar with. Concepts such as printing out text, taking input from a user, and concatenation were covered in todays lesson and by the end of it, I made a program that took user input and output a band name by concatenating the two strings. Overall it was a nice intro back into Python.
